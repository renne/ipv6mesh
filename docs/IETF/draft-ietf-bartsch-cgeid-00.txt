1  Introduction

   <Introduction Text>

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Special characters examples:

   The characters  , , , 
   However, the characters \0, \&, \%, \" are displayed.

   .ti 0  is displayed in text instead of used as a directive. 
   .\"  is displayed in document instead of being treated as a comment

   C:\dir\subdir\file.ext  Shows inclusion of backslash "\".

   Rationale and Intent

3  Security Considerations

   This document uses cryptographic algorithms and procedures, which can
   be broken. To ensure security cryptographic algorithms with a known
   pratically attack MUST NOT be used. As vendors tend to postpone
   security updates to save costs this document MUST become obsolete and
   MUST be replaced by an updated document in case there are no secure
   algorithms allowed by this document left.

   Poisoning attacks on the LISP mapping tables can render the global
   LISP-system useless. The processing power necessary for creating
   4096-bit based CGEID/public key/private key triplets reduces the rate
   and number of real CGEIDs one entity can generate. LISP
   implementations MUST check the signatures of the mapping records
   before further processing to avoid CGEID spoofing.


4  IANA Considerations

   This document requests a /64 IPv6 prefix for use as global CGEID
   space from the IANA without a hierarchical allocation outlined in
   [RFC5226]. This request is summarized in Table 1.

       +----------------------+--------------------------------+
       | Attribute            | Value                          |
       +----------------------+--------------------------------+
       | Address Block        | XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:/64 [1][2] |
       | Name                 | CGEID Space for LISP           |
       | RFC                  | [This Document]                |
       | Allocation Date      | November 2013                  |
       | Termination Date     | False                          |
       | Source               | True [3]                       |
       | Destination          | True                           |
       | Forwardable          | True                           |
       | Global               | True                           |
       | Reserved-by-protocol | True [4]                       |
       +----------------------+--------------------------------+

   [1] XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX value to be provided by IANA before published
   as RFC. [2] The IANA is asked to assign a prefix with a highly
   reduced notation to simplify usage by average users. [3] Can be used
   as a multicast source as well. [4] To be used as EID space by LISP
   [RFC6830] enabled devices.

   ToDo

   - CGA signature in mapping database possible/poisoning attacks?
   - To avoid bloating the BGP tables public PITRs MUST either publish the BGP-route of the CGEID-prefix as one single route or aggregated in a bigger IPv6-prefix.
   - acknowledgements
   - DNS PTRs
   - multicasted Webcam
   - PITRs MUST support multicast
   - export function for self-generated RSA-keys
   - import function for existing RSA-keys
   - accelerated global IPv6 deployment even without IPv6 support of ISPs
   - layer-3 ad-hoc MESH networks (ad-hoc CGEID + ad-hoc CGEID-> neighbour-CGEID (RLOC) mapping)
