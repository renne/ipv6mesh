Every node generates IPv6 addresses ad-hoc and connects to it's neighbour nodes which allows to deploy large number of nodes automagically.\r\n\r\n**IPv6MESH** can be used to set up emergency communication networks, vehicle-2-vehicle communication (car-2-car, ship-2-ship), can close gaps in networks by e.g. integrating nodes into reflector posts, streetlights, trees, moored buoys or balloons or just serve as a community network.\r\n\r\n\r\n##**Features:**\r\n* Security based on **4096-bit RSA** key-pairs\r\n* **C**ryptographically **G**enerated **E**ndpoint **I**dentifiers **(CGEIDs)**\r\n  * 32-bit IPv6 IANA prefix (XXXX:XXXX::0/32)\r\n  * 96-bit SHA-2 HASH of RSA public key as interface identifier\r\n  * Compatibel with 128-bit IPv6-addresses\r\n  * RSA-based authentication\r\n  * **Decentralized ad-hoc generation**\r\n  * Can be exchanged between users via QR-code, NFC, VCards, etc.\r\n* End-2-End payload encryption\r\n  * Exchange of random symmetric stream-cipher key by asymmetric RSA key pair\r\n  * AES-256 stream-cipher\r\n  * Perfect Forward Secrecy\r\n* D1HT routing table\r\n  * UDP transport\r\n  * Bootstrapping\r\n    * IPv6MESH nodes known via Neighbour Discovery Protocol\r\n    * IPv4/IPv6 anycast address\r\n  * CGEID-based index (prevents Sybil attacks)\r\n  * RSA-signed records (prevents Spartacus attacks)\r\n  * Record types of a IPv6MESH node\r\n    * CGEID/RSA public key tupel for authentication\r\n    * Point-2-Point IPv6MESH neighbours\r\n    * IPv4/IPv6 addresses\r\n    * Alternate CGEIDs (load-balancing, redundancy)\r\n    * NAT64 support\r\n    * Geographic position to provide distributed network coverage map\r\n  * Replaces BGP and STUN\r\n  * Survives (global) BGP and/or DNS blackout\r\n* Compatibility with IPv6 LANs\r\n  * CGEID creation/authorisation and payload encryption on IPv6MESH router\r\n  * CGEID provisioning for conventional IPv6 devices via DHCPv6\r\n* Compatibility with BGP-routed Internet\r\n  * All IPv6MESH nodes with IPv6 connectivity are ingress/egress border routers\r\n  * Ingress routing via Anycast addresses\r\n    * IPv6: XXXX:XXXX::0/32    -> XXXX:XXXX::1/128 -> IPv6 addresses of IPv6MESH nodes\r\n    * IPv4: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/32 ->                     IPv4 addresses of IPv6MESH nodes\r\n    * Any BGP operator can publish BGP routes by scanning the D1HT routing table\r\n* Tunneling between IPv6MESH clouds/isolated nodes via BGP-routed IPv4/IPv6 protocol\r\n* Implementation of onion routing depends on performance\r\n* Physical connectivity\r\n  * Wired communication\r\n    * IEEE 802.3 Clause 38 (1000Base-SX/LX) preferred\r\n    * IEEE 802.3 Clause 40 (1000Base-T) can be used with surge protection\r\n    * Wires can be DIY-installed between homes\r\n  * Radio communication\r\n    * IEEE 802.11ac preferred (802.11h necessary in most countries)\r\n    * IEEE 802.11ad as next generation (lobbyists needed to get reserved frequency range)\r\n    * Nodes SHALL use 3-dimensional beamforming and transmit power control to reduce electromagnetic interferences \r\n    * Unencrypted (B)SSID \"IETFRFC&lt;rfc number&gt;\" (&lt;rfc number&gt; = \"0000\" until formal release of RFC)\r\n* Filing of IETF Internet Draft planned when IPv6MESH scales well\r\n* **No support** for *Global No Such Agency Backup Service* **;-)** \r\n* Hardware/OS-independent\r\n* ***GPLv2 license*** (Flattr button/Bitcoin address must not be manipulated)\r\n* Coding conventions: https://github.com/renne/ipv6mesh/wiki/Coding-conventions\r\n* Feature requests and bugs: https://github.com/renne/ipv6mesh/issues\r\n* Wiki: https://github.com/renne/ipv6mesh/wiki\r\n\r\n##**Contact**\r\nEmail: webmaster *AT* ipv6mesh.eu\r\n\r\n##**Contribute**\r\n* You can ***support project IPv6MESH*** (hardware, internet connectivity, domains, administrative costs, ...) via Flattr by starring on GitHub\r\n* Fork, write code and make a pull request\r\n* Test and register bugs at https://github.com/renne/ipv6mesh/issues\r\n* Contribute to the Wiki at https://github.com/renne/ipv6mesh/wiki\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
