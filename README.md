========

**IPv6MESH** is a mesh network extension for the Internet Protocol 6 (OSI Layer 3). Every node generates IPv6 addresses ad-hoc and connects to it's neighbour nodes which allows to deploy large number of nodes automagically.

**IPv6MESH** can be used to set up emergency communication networks, vehicle-2-vehicle communication (car-2-car, ship-2-ship), can close gaps in networks by e.g. integrating nodes into reflector posts, streetlights, trees, moored buoys or balloons or just serve as a community network.


##**Features:**
* Security based on **4096-bit RSA** key-pairs
* **C**ryptographically **G**enerated **E**ndpoint **I**dentifiers **(CGEIDs)**
  * 32-bit IPv6 IANA prefix (XXXX:XXXX::0/32)
  * 96-bit SHA-2 HASH of RSA public key as interface identifier
  * Compatibel with 128-bit IPv6-addresses
  * RSA-based authentication
  * **Decentralized ad-hoc generation**
  * Import/export/backup (CGEID, public/private key) via PKCS12 files named "&lt;CGEID&gt;.p12"
  * CGEID can be exchanged between users via QR-code, NFC, VCards, etc.
  * IPv6MESH router operators don't have to provide any public IPv6 addresses
* NAT64 gateway support
  * Provide connectivity to IPv4 hosts
  * Can be registered as internet service provider to avoid german "StÃ¶rerhaftung"
* End-2-End payload encryption
  * Exchange of random symmetric stream-cipher key by asymmetric RSA key pair
  * AES-256 stream-cipher
  * Perfect Forward Secrecy
* D1HT for distributed information about hosts
  * UDP transport
  * Bootstrapping
    * IPv6MESH nodes known via Neighbour Discovery Protocol
    * IPv4/IPv6 anycast address
  * CGEID-based index (prevents Sybil attacks)
  * RSA-signed records (prevents Spartacus attacks)
  * Record types of a IPv6MESH node
    * CGEID/RSA public key tupel for authentication
    * Point-2-Point IPv6MESH neighbours
    * IPv4/IPv6 addresses
    * Alternate CGEIDs (load-balancing, redundancy)
    * NAT64 support
    * Geographic position to provide distributed network coverage map
  * Replaces BGP, STUN and LISP map-servers/resolvers
  * Survives (global) BGP and/or DNS blackout
* Compatibility with IPv6 LANs
  * CGEID creation/authorisation and payload encryption on IPv6MESH router
  * CGEID provisioning for conventional IPv6 devices via DHCPv6
* Compatibility with BGP-routed Internet
  * All IPv6MESH nodes with IPv6 connectivity are ingress/egress border routers
  * Ingress routing via Anycast addresses
    * IPv6: XXXX:XXXX::0/32    -> XXXX:XXXX::1/128 -> IPv6 addresses of IPv6MESH nodes
    * IPv4: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/32 ->                     IPv4 addresses of IPv6MESH nodes
    * Any BGP operator can scan the D1HT and publish BGP routes via e.g. Quagga extension
* LISP-tunneling
  * Connectivity between IPv6MESH clouds/isolated nodes
  * IPv4/IPv6 locators
* Implementation of onion routing depends on performance
* Physical connectivity
  * Wires and radio links can be DIY-installed between homes
  * Wired communication
    * IEEE 802.3 Clause 38 (1000Base-SX/LX) preferred
    * IEEE 802.3 Clause 40 (1000Base-T) can be used with surge protection
  * Radio communication
    * IEEE 802.11ac preferred (802.11h necessary in most countries)
    * IEEE 802.11ad as next generation (lobbyists needed to get reserved frequency range)
    * Reduction of electromagnetic interferences on other IPv6MESH nodes
      * Transmit Power Control
      * 2-dimensional beamforming
    * Unencrypted (B)SSID "IETFRFC&lt;rfc number&gt;" ("ipv6mesh.eu" until formal release of RFC)
* Filing of IETF Internet Draft planned when IPv6MESH scales well
* **No support** for *Global No Such Agency Backup Service* **;-)** 
* Hardware/OS-independent
